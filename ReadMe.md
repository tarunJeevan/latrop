### Camera Projection

- [tainted-coders-reference](https://taintedcoders.com/bevy/cameras#viewports)
- Bevy's default camera uses orthogonal projection with a symmetric frustrum
- *Projection* refers to the process of transforming a 3D scene into a 2D representation
- *Orthongonal Projection* is a type of projection that preserves relative sizes
- *Frustrun* refers to a truncated pyramid shape that represents the field of view
- *Symmetric Frustrun* has the top and bottom as well as the right and left sides equal in size and shape
